This package contains useful classes and methods that can be reused throughout the program.
Other useful utilities can be added to this package to be used. As they are added, add
them to the list with a short description of how to use it.

1.	RobotLog
2.	MathUtil

1.	RobotLog
	
	- RobotLog is a method used for displaying messages on the SmartDashboard. Two methods within
		it can be accessed. 
		
		void RobotLog.init()
			-	This method should be place in the the initialization function of RobotMain. 
				RobotLog.init() creates the RobotLog to be used later.
		
		void RobotLog.putMessage(String message)
			-	putMessage() can be used in any part of the program necessary for displaying values
				that can be read during and after testing. It takes a String argument that gets 
				added to an array of 64 Strings, which are displayed to the SmartDashboard with 
				a time stamp of when it was printed.
				
2.	MathUtil
	
	- This class contains useful snippets of code that would otherwise be repeated unnecessarily.
		It is more of a convenience than a necessity, but it makes the code easier to follow.
		
		double/float MathUtil.limitMin(double/float input, double/float minimum)
			-	MathUtil.limitMin() takes two values, and prevents the output from being lower than
				the value set as the minimum. The method is overloaded for either double or float
				inputs and outputs.
				
		double/float MathUtil.limitMax(double/float input, double/float maximum)
			-	This method is the same as the above, but is used for setting a maximum value.
			
		double/float MathUtil.setLimits(double/float input, double/float minimum, double/float maximum)
			-	This method implements the setting of both a minimum and a maximum.
